# 7nm-layouts-for-DSA_MP
A benchmark for evaluating DSA_MP performance at the 7 nm node, featuring 15 synthetic layouts with full test datasets and design rules provided. The industrial layout is subject to confidentiality constraints and is therefore not included in this repository.
## wire generation
- **wire_cd (w)**: The critical dimension of metal wire shapes, defined by wire width.  
  - Value: **21 nm**

- **track_pitch (p)**: The distance between adjacent wire tracks.  
  - Metal 1 Value: **42 nm**
  - Metal 2 Value: **31.5 nm**

## via generation

- **via_x (vₓ)**: Via size along the x direction.  
  - Value: **21 nm**

- **via_y (vᵧ)**: Via size along the y direction.  
  - Value: **21 nm**

- **density (ρ)**: The probability of a via appearing at a candidate via location.  
  - Value: **0.5**
